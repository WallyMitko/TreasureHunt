# TreasureHunt
A basic iOS app where the user scans a series of QR codes to uncover clues.  
Created as part of my Christmas present for my sister :)

If you want to make your own version of this game, simply modify clues.json and make sure any new clues have unique UUIDs.  
You can change the initially unlocked clues by changing `initialClues` in `Clue.swift`.
